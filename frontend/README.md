# Frontend - Smart Campus Prototype

This is a static frontend using vanilla HTML/JS that subscribes to the backend WebSocket at ws://localhost:4000

For quick testing you can open `index.html` directly in the browser, but some browsers block local ws from file:// — in that case run a simple static server like `npx serve` or `python -m http.server` from this folder.
